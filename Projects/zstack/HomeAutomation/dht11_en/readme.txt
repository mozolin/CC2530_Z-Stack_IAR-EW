The 40-bit humidity and temperature data inside the sensor is transmitted to the microcontroller at one time, and the data is verified by checksum method, which effectively ensures the accuracy of data transmission. The power consumption of DHT is very low.

The maximum communication time of DHT11 is 3ms, and the continuous sampling interval of the host is recommended to be no less than 100ms.
