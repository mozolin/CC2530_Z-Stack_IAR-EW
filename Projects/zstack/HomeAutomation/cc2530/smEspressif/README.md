ESP-IDF template app
====================

This is a template application to be used with [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.

Using this application template, you can use the ESP-IDF serial monitor inside Espressif IDE

It is also possible to use ESP-IDF PowerShell for this purpose. But in this case, you need to go to the folder with the application. Otherwise, the escape sequences will not be displayed correctly
